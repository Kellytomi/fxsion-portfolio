# PWA Icons

You need to create the following icon files for Progressive Web App support:

1. `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels
2. `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels

These should be created from your logo (Fxsion logo) and placed in this directory.

You can use tools like Photoshop, GIMP, or online converters to create these icons from your existing logo files.

Once created, these icons will be used for PWA installation on mobile devices and will appear on home screens when users add your site to their device.
